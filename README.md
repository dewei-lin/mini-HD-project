# Huntingtonâ€™s Disease Mini Project

##  How to use this repository?

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dewei-lin/mini-HD-project.git
cd mini-HD-project
```

Then, you would need to build the Docker image for this project with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t mini-hd-project .
```

After that, you would be able to run the project in the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/project mini-hd-project bash
```

To generate the plots with Makefile:

```bash
make all
```

To run the Shiny app:

```bash
docker run -p 3838:3838 -v $(pwd):/project mini-hd-project make run-shiny
```

And visit in your local computer at http://127.0.0.1:3838 (http://127.0.0.1:3838). Or directly visit the R shiny app in web browser: https://dewei-lin.shinyapps.io/survival_compare/ (https://dewei-lin.shinyapps.io/survival_compare/)




##  What is Huntingtonâ€™s Disease?

Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the HTT gene. The mutation leads to an abnormal repetition of the CAG trinucleotide sequence, resulting in progressive brain cell damage. Symptoms of HD typically appear between the ages of 30 and 50 and include motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances.

To better illustrate the rapid progression of Huntingtonâ€™s disease, here is an animation:

This animation demonstrates how quickly the disease can advance, emphasizing the need for early intervention and continuous care.

##  Helping Patients with Decision-Making

One critical aspect of Huntingtonâ€™s disease is helping patients make life decisions based on their genetic predisposition. Specifically, the number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene and the patientâ€™s age are crucial in estimating the likelihood of disease onset and progression.

While research offers various models to predict outcomes, comparing different approaches is necessary to guide tailored interventions. For instance, there are two models in the practical use of predicting HD progression, CAP (Zhang et al., 2011) and Langbehn model (Langbehn et al., 2004). In order to demonstrate the similarities as well as the differences between two models, an interactive R shiny app is created for both statisticians and non-statisticians:

Stay tuned as we continue building tools and models to support HD patients and their families in navigating this challenging journey.
